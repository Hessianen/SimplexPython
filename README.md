# SimplexPython
Curvefitting and plottning code scripted in Python with interest towards paralell curvfitting of data with common constraints.


Plan is to:
0. Design the program-structure
1. firt try to separate the parts from the old scripts (Simplex.py) into individual files and along the way implement the Object-oriented curves.
2. adding more fitting function like gaussian, lorenzian, assymetric, custom equation (will require some generalisation!!!)
3. implement a plotting part (pyplot)
4. implement a dataloading part (part of GUI at a later stage)
5. implement a GUI
6. implement the constraint and linking-part... take inspiration from spancf but improve (simultaneous fitting)
7.
